<p>
My name is Hudson Yeung. I'm currently a Junior at Rutgers-Newark
studying computer science. I  was first introduced to programming in sophomore year of high school. 
I've always been enthusiastic about video games ever since my father bought me my first PlayStation.
Eventually after my gaming and computer science experiences intertwined, I became interested in computer software and 
their applications. I wanted to learn more about the foundations of these games, which 
then led me to the study of computer science.
