<p>
My name is Hudson Yeung. I'm currently a sophomore at Rutgers-Newark
studying computer science. I was raised in Edison New Jesey and was first introduced
to coding in sophomore year in highschool. I've always been enthusiastic about 
gaming. Eventually after my gaming and computer science experience intertwined, my interest in computer software and 
their applications developed. I wanted to learn more about the foundations of these games, which 
then lead me to the study of computer science.
