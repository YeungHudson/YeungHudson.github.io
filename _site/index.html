<p>Hello! My name is Hudson Yeung and I am graduated from Rutgers in May 2019. My major is in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics.
I was first introduced to programming in sophomore year of high school. Iâ€™ve always been enthusiastic about video games ever since my father bought me my first PlayStation. Eventually after my gaming and computer science experiences intertwined, I became interested in computer software and their applications.</p>
