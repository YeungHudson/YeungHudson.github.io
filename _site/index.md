### Introductions

Hello! My name is Hudson Yeung and I am graduated from Rutgers in May 2019. My major is in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics.
I was first introduced to programming in sophomore year of high school. I've always been enthusiastic about video games ever since my father bought me my first PlayStation. Eventually after my gaming and computer science experiences intertwined, I became interested in computer software and their applications.
